        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>Design test programs for Automated Testing Equipment using Visual Basic program. Used 
              custom built objects to control the mode and functionality of the tester in order to optimize the 
              robustness and speed of test programs used in IC production as well as design extensive 
              characterization programs that test all aspects of the circuit design. </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>Write scripts using Perl and Python that create digital patterns used by the ATE. Using an I2C 
                interface, patterns will read and write from registers that control tests modes of a chip. Patterns 
                will test memory blocks, low voltage comparators and the I2C port itself. 
                Test for analog performance on audio equipment with mobile applications using transforms and 
                windowing functions. </p>
              </li>
              <li><p>Design and layout circuit boards for integrating with automated test equipment to run test 
                programs. Analyze the performance specifications of op-amps and other components before 
                using them to create filters and buffers for audio signals, and integrate with built in tester 
                components such as DACs and ADCs </p></li>
                <li><p>Monitor yields of probed circuit wafers at overseas facility, and corrected issues as necessary. 
                  Work with Quality Management to assure units were meeting customer specifications. Qualify 
                  fabrication facilities for new products. Observe correlation between different tests to consider 
                  unnecessary/overlapping test coverage. </p></li>
                  <li><p>Communicate with customer on Return Merchandise Authorization (RMA) forms and sent 
                    failed units to laboratory for analysis. </p></li>
                  </ul>
