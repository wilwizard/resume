Used \r\ncustom built objects to control the mode and functionality of the tester in order to optimize the \r\nrobustness and speed of test programs used in IC production as well as design extensive \r\ncharacterization programs that test all aspects of the circuit design. \r\n\r\n* Write scripts using Perl and Python that create digital patterns used by the ATE. Using an I2C \r\ninterface, patterns will read and write from registers that control tests modes of a chip. Patterns \r\nwill test memory blocks, low voltage comparators and the I2C port itself. \r\nTest for analog performance on audio equipment with mobile applications using transforms and \r\nwindowing functions. \r\n\r\n* Design and layout circuit boards for integrating with automated test equipment to run test \r\nprograms. Analyze the performance specifications of op-amps and other components before \r\nusing them to create filters and buffers for audio signals, and integrate with built in tester \r\ncomponents such as DACs and ADCs \r\n\r\n* Monitor yields of probed circuit wafers at overseas facility, and corrected issues as necessary. \r\nWork with Quality Management to assure units were meeting customer specifications. Qualify \r\nfabrication facilities for new products. Observe correlation between different tests to consider \r\nunnecessary/overlapping test coverage. \r\n\r\n* Communicate with customer on Return Merchandise Authorization (RMA) forms and sent \r\nfailed units to laboratory for analysis. \r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
